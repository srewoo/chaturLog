**This is a PRODUCTION-LEVEL innovation!** 🎉

#### **🎨 Custom AI Prompts**

Users can create custom prompts for:
- System instructions
- Analysis strategies
- Test generation templates

**Value:** Domain-specific customization (e.g., security testing, performance testing)

#### **🔐 User-Managed API Keys**

- Each user configures their own API keys
- Supports 3 AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Secure storage with encryption

**Value:** Multi-tenant ready, flexible cost management

#### **📊 Context-Aware Test Generation**

Analyzes project structure to generate tests that:
- Match existing test patterns
- Use correct import paths
- Follow project conventions

**Value:** Generated tests integrate seamlessly (not generic!)

### 5. **Cost Efficiency**

**Chunking Pipeline Cost Analysis:**

| Log Size | Old Approach | ChaturLog Chunking | Savings |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 100KB | Manual (4 hrs) | $0.05 + 10 mins | **$200** |
| 1MB | Impossible | $0.10 + 15 mins | **Priceless** |
| 3.5MB | Impossible | $0.16 + 20 mins | **Priceless** |
| 10MB+ | Impossible | $0.50 + 45 mins | **Priceless** |

**ROI Calculation (Small Team):**
- Manual log analysis: 10 hrs/week × $50/hr = **$500/week**
- ChaturLog cost: API usage ≈ **$20/week**
- **Net Savings: $480/week = $25,000/year per team!**
